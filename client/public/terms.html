      </ul>
    </div>

  <div class="about-block road-map" style="background: white none repeat scroll 0% 0%;">
    <div class="about-text term-text">
      <p>
        The Terms described here govern your use of MotoMob and other MotoMob owned products, features, apps, services,
        technologies and software that we
        offer (the MotoMob Products or MMP), except where we expressly state that separate additional terms apply. All
        MMP are provided to you by MotoMob
        Limited based in the UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't charge you to use MMP covered by these Terms. Where a MMP can incur a charge, such as selling a product
        on MotoMob Marketplace, we will
        explicitly inform you of this and will give you the option to avoid any charges where applicable. To generate
        revenue, we allow individuals,
        businesses and organisations to pay us to show you ads for their products and services. By using our Products,
        you agree that we can show you ads that
        we think will be relevant to you and your interests. We use your personal data and behaviour-based data such as
        the bikes you own, bikes you follow,
        trips you have taken, locations you follow, and other data points to help determine which ads to show you. We
        will allow you to control the ads you
        see through the 'adverts' section on your profile.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't sell your personal data to advertisers, and we don't share information that directly identifies you
        (such as your name, email address or
        other contact information) with advertisers. At no point will MM share your data with any third-party
        organisation that can identify you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advertisers can tell us things such as the kind of audience that they want to see their ads or people who are
        genuinely interested in their products
        or services and we show those ads to people who may be interested in such adverts. We provide advertisers with
        reports about the performance of their
        ads that help them understand how people are interacting with their content. You have the full flexibility to
        control what you see and what you don't
        want to see through your personal settings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our data policy explains how we collect and use your personal data to enhance your experience on MotoMob and
        MMP. We keep your data in secure servers
        under global and country-specific regulations.
      </p>
      <h2>The services we provide</h2>
      <p>
        Our mission is to give motorcyclists the power to become part of a global motorcycling community and bring the
        world of riders closer together.
        MotoMob is a biker network that enhances a motorcyclist's way of life. To help advance this mission, we provide
        the products and services described
        below to you:
      </p>
      <h3>Provide a personalised experience for you:</h3>
      <p>
        Your experience on MMP is designed to enhance your lifestyle. From the posts related to motorbikes, travel
        stories, events, competitions, ads, forum
        content, video, images, the marketplace and other features that you might use and new features we will introduce
        as we grow the platform. We use the
        data that we have – for example, about the connections you make, the choices you make, the bikes you own, the
        bikes you would like to own, places that
        you want to go, places that you have been, settings you select, and what you share and do on and off our
        Products – to personalise your experience.
      </p>
      <h3>We connect you with riders, products, content and organisations that you care about:</h3>
      <p>
        We use the data that we have to make suggestions for you and others – for example, if you own a Husqvarna 701,
        we might connect you with a small
        business that designs products for it. Or, if you are interested in going to Morocco, we will suggest you
        articles and riders on MM travel section
        related to travelling to Morocco.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stronger ties make for a better global biker community that can help each other experience the world on their
        motorbikes. We believe that MMP services
        are most useful when riders are sharing their expertise on our platform sections such as travel, forum and
        bikes, etc.
      </p>
      <h3>Help you signin content, products and services that may interest you:</h3>
      <p>
        We show you organic content and sponsored content such as ads, offers, and other sponsored content to help you
        signin content, products and services
        that are offered by the many businesses and organisations that use MM and MMP.
      </p>
      <h3>Combat harmful conduct, false information and protect and support our members:</h3>
      <p>
        Everyone on MM must feel safe. We (will) employ dedicated teams around the world and develop advanced technical
        systems to detect misuse of MMP and
        harmful conduct towards our members. In situations where we may be able to help, we will take the necessary
        steps to support and protect our
        community. If we learn of content or conduct like this, we will take appropriate action – for example, offering
        help, removing content, blocking
        access to certain features, disabling an account or contacting law enforcement. MMP uses a single source of data
        as such can quickly respond to member
        concerns.
      </p>
      <h3>Use and develop advanced technologies to provide safe and functional services for everyone:</h3>
      <p>
        We use and develop advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning systems and other
        innovative tech solutions so that people
        can use our platform safely regardless of geographic location. We develop automated systems to improve our
        ability to detect and remove abusive and
        dangerous activity that may harm our community and the integrity of our Products.
      </p>
      <h3>Enable global access to our services:</h3>
      <p>
        As we grow, to operate our global service, we will need to store and distribute content and data in our data
        centres and systems around the world,
        including outside your country of residence. In all such cases, we will adhere to all local and global rules and
        regulations.
      </p>
      <h3>How our services are funded</h3>
      <p>
        MotoMob and MMP are free for everyone. Some special features, such as selling a product in our marketplace, will
        incur a small charge. In all such
        scenarios, we will explicitly inform you of the terms before you use the service.
      </p>
      <p>As a startup, today, we are privately funded by angel investors. As we grow and to support our growth, we will
        seek further private investment.</p>
      <p>We will be building new features to generate revenue through targetted advertising, the marketplace, brand
        partnerships and PaaS.</p>
      <h3>Our Competitions</h3>
      <p>
        Time to time we conduct competitions to provide the member of MotoMob an opportunity to win prizes. To
        participate in these competitions you must agree and abide by the criteria of the competition and agree to
        additional terms. The criteria of the competition are published in the “Competitions” section of the platform
        under each competition. Where applicable you will be asked to explicitly agree to the criteria.
      </p>
      <p>
        The additional Terms of Use for the competitions can be seen <a href="/competition-terms-of-use.html"
          style="color: #424242;"><strong>here</strong></a>. By using the platform, you agree to the terms shown in <a
          href="/competition-terms-of-use.html" style="color: #424242;"><strong>Competition Terms of Use
            page.</strong></a>
      </p>
      <h2>Your commitments to MotoMob</h2>
      <p>
        Protecting people's privacy is central to how we've designed our system. We don't sell your personal data. We
        allow advertisers to tell us things such
        as their business goal, and the kind of audience that they want to see their ads (for example, riders who own
        BMW R1200GS). We then show their ad to
        people who might be interested.
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't share information that directly identifies you (information such as your name or email address that by
        itself can be used to contact you or
        identifies who you are).
      </p>
      <p>We provide these services to you to help advance our mission. In exchange, we need you to make the following
        commitments:</p>
      <h3>Who can use MotoMob</h3>
      <p>When people stand behind their opinions and actions, our community is safer and more accountable. For this
        reason, you must:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>use the same name that you use in everyday life;</li>
        <li>provide accurate information about yourself;</li>
        <li>create only one account (your own) and use your timeline for personal purposes; and</li>
        <li>not share your password, give access to your MotoMob account to others or transfer your account to anyone
          else.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We try to make MotoMob broadly available to everyone, even though the platform is designed specifically to
        motorbikers.</p>
      <p>You cannot use MotoMob if:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>You are under 16 years old.</li>
        <li>We've previously disabled your account for breaches of our Terms or Policies.</li>
        <li>You are prohibited from receiving our products, services or software under applicable laws.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>What you can share and do on MotoMob</h3>
      <p>
        We want people to use MotoMob to express themselves and to share content that is important to them, but not at
        the expense of the safety and
        well-being of others or the integrity of our community. You therefore agree not to engage in the conduct
        described below (or to facilitate or support
        others in doing so):
      </p>
      <h4>You may not use our Products to do or share anything:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>That breaches these Terms</li>
        <li>That is unlawful, misleading, discriminatory or fraudulent.</li>
        <li>That infringes or violates someone else's rights, including their intellectual property rights.</li>
      </ul>
      <h4>
        You may not upload viruses or malicious code, or do anything that could disable, overburden or impair the proper
        working or appearance of our
        Products.
      </h4>
      <h4>You may not access or collect data from our Products using automated means or attempt to access data that you
        do not have permission to access.</h4>
      <p>
        We can remove or block users and content that is in breach of these provisions. If we remove content that you
        have shared for breach of our Community
        Standards, we'll let you know and explain any options that you have to request another review, unless you
        seriously or repeatedly breach these Terms
        or if doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere
        with the integrity or operation of any
        of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are
        prohibited from doing so for legal
        reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help support our community, we encourage you to report content or conduct that you believe breaches your
        rights (including intellectual property
        rights) or our terms and policies. You can report these to <a
          href="mailto:report@motomob.me">report@motomob.me</a>.
      </p>
      <h3>The permissions you give us</h3>
      <p>We need certain permissions from you to provide our services:</p>
      <h4>Permission to use content that you create and share:</h4>
      <p>
        Some content that you share or upload, such as photos or videos, may be protected by intellectual property laws.
        You own the intellectual property
        rights (things such as copyright or trademarks) in any such content that you create and share on MotoMob and the
        other MotoMob Products you use.
        Nothing in these Terms takes away the rights you have to your own content. You are free to share your content
        with anyone else, wherever you want.
        However, to provide our services, we need you to give us some legal permissions (known as a 'licence') to use
        this content. This is solely for the
        purposes of providing and improving our products and services, as described above.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifically, when you share, post or upload content that is covered by intellectual property rights on or in
        connection with our products, you grant
        us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, royalty-free and worldwide licence to host, use, distribute,
        modify, run, copy, publicly perform or
        display, translate and create derivative works of your content. This means, for example, that if you share a
        photo of your motorbike on MotoMob, you
        give us permission to store, copy and share it with others. This licence will end when your content is deleted
        from our systems. You can delete
        content individually or all at once by deleting your account. When you delete content, it's no longer visible to
        other users; however, it may continue
        to exist elsewhere on our systems where:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Immediate deletion is not possible due to technical limitations (in which case, your content will be deleted
          within a maximum of 90 days from when
          you remove it);
        </li>
        <li>
          You have foregone your right to delete the content in a specific area by explicitly agreeing to it. For
          example: submitting your photograph to a
          MotoMob contest;
        </li>
        <li>
          Your content has been used by others in accordance with this licence, and they have not deleted it (in which
          case, this licence will continue to
          apply until that content is deleted); or
        </li>
        <li>
          Where immediate deletion would restrict our ability to:
          <ul>
            <li>
              investigate or identify illegal activity or breaches of our Terms and Policies (for example, to identify
              or investigate misuse of our Products
              or systems);
            </li>
            <li>comply with a legal obligation, such as the preservation of evidence; or</li>
            <li>
              comply with a request of a judicial or administrative authority, law enforcement or a government agency;
              In which case, the content will be
              retained for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which it has been retained (the exact
              duration will vary on a case-by-case
              basis).In each of the above cases, this licence will continue until the content has been fully deleted.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Permission to use your name, profile picture and information about your actions with ads and sponsored
        content:</h4>
      <p>
        You give us permission to use your name and profile picture and information about actions that you have taken on
        MotoMob next to or in connection with
        ads, offers and other sponsored content that we display across our Products, without any compensation to you.
      </p>
      <h4>Permission to update software that you use or download:</h4>
      <p>If you download or use our software, you give us permission to download and install updates to the software
        where applicable.</p>
        <h4>Permission for User tracking</h4>
        <p>We use technologies, such as cookies, and process personal data, such as IP addresses and cookie identifiers, 
          to identify content based on your interests, measure the performance of ads and content, and derive insights about
          the audiences who saw ads and content. You agree to the use of this technology and the processing of your personal
          data for these purposes within the broader remit of GDPR</p>
      <h3>Limits on using our intellectual property</h3>
      <p>
        If you use content covered by intellectual property rights that we have and make available in our Products (for
        example, images, designs, videos or
        sounds that we provide, which you add to content that you create or share on MotoMob), we retain all rights to
        that content (but not yours). You can
        only use our copyrights or trademarks (or any similar marks) as expressly permitted by our Brand Usage
        Guidelines or with our prior written
        permission. You must obtain our written permission (or permission under an open source licence) to modify,
        create derivative works of, decompile or
        otherwise attempt to extract source code from us.
      </p>
      <h2>Additionally...</h2>
      <h3>Updating our Terms</h3>
      <p>
        We constantly work to improve our services and develop new features to make our Products better for you and our
        community. As a result, we may need to
        update these Terms from time to time to accurately reflect our services and practices. We will only make changes
        if the provisions are no longer
        appropriate or if they are incomplete, and only if the changes are reasonable and take due account of your
        interests. We will notify you (for example,
        by email or through our Products) at least 30 days before we make changes to these Terms and give you an
        opportunity to review them before they go
        into effect, unless the changes are required by law. Once any updated Terms are in effect, you will be bound by
        them if you continue to use our
        Products. We hope that you will continue using our Products, but if you do not agree to our updated Terms and no
        longer want to be part of MotoMob,
        you can delete your account at any time.
      </p>
      <h3>Account suspension or termination</h3>
      <p>
        We want MotoMob to be a place where people feel welcome and safe to express themselves and share their thoughts
        and ideas. If we determine that you
        have clearly, seriously or repeatedly breached our Terms or Policies, including in particular our Community
        Standards, we may suspend or permanently
        disable access to your account. We may also suspend or disable your account if you repeatedly infringe other
        people's intellectual property rights or
        where we are required to do so for legal reasons. Where we take such action, we'll let you know and explain any
        options you have to request a review,
        unless doing so may expose us or others to legal liability; harm our community of users; compromise or interfere
        with the integrity or operation of
        any of our services, systems or Products; where we are restricted due to technical limitations; or where we are
        prohibited from doing so for legal
        reasons.
      </p>
      <h3>Limits on liability</h3>
      <p>
        Nothing in these Terms is intended to exclude or limit our liability for death, personal injury or fraudulent
        misrepresentation caused by our
        negligence, or to affect your statutory rights. We will exercise professional diligence in providing our
        Products and services to you and in keeping a
        safe, secure and error-free environment. Provided that we have acted with professional diligence, we do not
        accept responsibility for losses not
        caused by our breach of these Terms or otherwise by our acts; losses that are not reasonably foreseeable by you
        and us at the time of entering into
        these Terms; and events beyond our reasonable control.
      </p>
      <h3>Disputes</h3>
      <p>
        We try to provide clear rules so that we can limit or hopefully avoid disputes between you and us. If a dispute
        does arise, however, it's useful to
        know upfront where it can be resolved and what laws will apply. If you are a consumer and habitually reside in a
        Member State of the European Union,
        the laws of that Member State will apply to any claim, cause of action or dispute that you have against us,
        which arises out of or relates to these
        Terms or the MotoMob Products ("claim"), and you may resolve your claim in any competent court in that Member
        State that has jurisdiction over the
        claim. In all other cases, you agree that the claim must be resolved in a competent court in the United Kingdom
        and that English law will govern these
        Terms and any claim, without regard to conflict of law provisions.
      </p>
      <h3>Other</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          These Terms (formerly known as the Statement of Rights and Responsibilities) make up the entire agreement
          between you and MotoMob Limited regarding
          your use of our Products. They supersede any prior agreements.
        </li>
        <li>
          Some of the Products that we offer are also governed by supplemental Terms. If you use any of these Products,
          you will be provided with an
          opportunity to agree to additional terms that will become part of our agreement with you. For instance, if you
          access or use our marketplace. To the
          extent that any supplemental Terms conflict with these Terms, the supplemental Terms shall govern to the
          extent of the conflict.
        </li>
        <li>
          If any portion of these Terms is found to be unenforceable, the remaining portion will remain in full force
          and effect. If we fail to enforce any of
          these Terms, it will not be considered a waiver. Any amendment to or waiver of these Terms must be made in
          writing and signed by us.
        </li>
        <li>You will not transfer any of your rights or obligations under these Terms to anyone else without our
          consent.</li>
        <li>
          You may designate a person (called a legacy contact) to manage your account if it is memorialised. Only your
          legacy contact or a person whom you
          have identified in a valid will or similar document expressing clear consent to disclose your content upon
          death or incapacity will be able to seek
          disclosure from your account after it is memorialised.
        </li>
        <li>
          These Terms do not confer any third-party beneficiary rights. All of our rights and obligations under these
          Terms are freely assignable by us in
          connection with a merger, acquisition or sale of assets, or by operation of law or otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
          You should know that we may need to change the username for your account in certain circumstances (for
          example, if someone else claims the username
          and it appears unrelated to the name that you use in everyday life). We will inform you in advance if we have
          to do this and explain why.
        </li>
        <li>
          We always appreciate your feedback and other suggestions about our products and services. But you should know
          that we may use them without any
          restriction or obligation to compensate you, and we are under no obligation to keep them confidential.
