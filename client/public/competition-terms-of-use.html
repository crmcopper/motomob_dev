                its sole discretion. The MotoMob team, deemed as resident judges/curators or any other assigned MotoMob
                team member, can (i) select the winners of
                any contest, or (ii) provide a preliminary list of finalists to any guest or exterior judge/curator, or

                announced prize.

            <p>
                Winners will be announced after the Required Confirmation is received and the respective winners are
                confirmed. MotoMob, MotoMob’s Sponsors and/or MotoMob’s Partners reserves the right to announce prize
